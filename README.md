# Tandem Technical Test

Welcome!

In this test, you will be improving a web application that displays live arrival times for a bus stop. Read the requirements below and make changes to the front-end and back-end of the application that you feel best meet all the requirements. You should spend no more than 2-3 hours in total. Use any tools you need to complete the task (e.g. Google, StackOverflow, NPM packages).

**Project structure**

Web - React TypeScript application accessible at http://localhost:8080. Generated with Vite (similar to Create React App).

API - Node.js TypeScript application accessible at http://localhost:3000. Generated with Nest.JS framework (similar to Express.js).

## Requirements

- [x] The app should fetch and display bus times from the existing `\bus-times` API endpoint on page load  
- [x] The app should highlight when buses are due (1 minute or less til arrival)  
- [x] The app should automatically refetch the bus times every 10 seconds  
- [x] The user should only see routes that run on the current day of the week  
- [x] The app should match the design outlined in the mockup below
